Sales Calculator
================
An app I created for personal business.
Currently releasing as an example of my work,
as it examplifies the following:
* PWA / offline capabilities
* Accurate calculations with monetary values (which cannot be done naïvely computing them as floating-points)
* Undo / redo with the command pattern
* Dark / light themes, with a toggle
* Semantic HTML (e.g. use of tables for displaying tabular data)
* Modern CSS features such as Flexbox && Grid
* The Observer pattern (using it atop JavaScript's Event-Driven architecture feels a tad silly, but I wanted to give it a try; kinda gives a yin-yang effect)
* Casual prototyping without the use of a framework (which would be a tad overkill for an offline SPA)
* H*ck, it even has a Roman numeral converter… (bored programming always yields interesting results!)
* Probably more dumb stuff I added because of free time
