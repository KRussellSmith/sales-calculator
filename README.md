Sales Calculator
================
An app I created for personal matters.
Currently releasing as an example of my work,
as it examplifies the following:
* PWA / offline capabilities
* Accurate calculations with monetary values
* Undo / redo with the command pattern
* Dark / light themes, with a toggle
* Semantic HTML (e.g. use of tables for displaying tabular data)
* Modern CSS features such as Flexbox & Grid
* The Observer pattern (using it atop JavaScript's Event-Driven architecture feels a tad silly, but I wanted to give it a try; kinda has a yin-yang effect)
* H\*ck, it even has a Roman numeral converterâ€¦ (bored programming always yields interesting results!)

**NOTE:**  While the code (including comments) are in English, the application itself is in Spanish; this otherwise capricious decision is due to my desire to learn the common app interface commands in Spanish.
